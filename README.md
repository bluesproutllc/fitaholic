## Description
InstaTrainer is a two-sided platform that facilitates communication between physical trainers and fitness enthusiasts. During the COVID-19 pandemic, trainers have limited close contact with their clients and need a platform to keep in touch. Clients need a way to get personalized plans remotely and track their progress. InstaTrainer is a mobile-first web app that supports trainer-client communication, exercise planning, and progress tracking.
